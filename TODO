Requirements for next milestone:
* Refactorize code (especially favor C++ STL over C etc.)
* Update and document the API properly
* Sanitize constructors, destructors and overload various recommended operators etc.

Less urgent:
* Implement support for loading BMP
* Implement complete exception handling
* Implement Format 2, Format 40 & Format 80 encoders (for creating new CPS, SHP & WSA graphics)
* Add some example code demonstrating the API.
* Fix portability issues wrt. windows & non-gcc compilers
* Make API compatible with C
* Move seed generator from doonlunacy to this library
* Add support for MIDI SFX
* Do better for conversion to ie. SDL::Surface etc.?
* Add back debug logging, only new and improved
* Hook XMIDI up to OPL emulator
* Separate some code from Emc* classes into a new base class to share with EMC interpreters
