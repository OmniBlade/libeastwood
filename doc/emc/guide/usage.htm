It's very easy to use these programs. They are designed to work in command-line environment
but if you don't like it you can also make shortcuts for Windows which is very easy.
The usage is simple, here's for decoder:
<UL><LI><KBD>
DEMC in >out</KBD></LI></UL>
The ">" character is needed to redirect output because <I>demc</I> is using standard output (f.e. console).
So if you wish to decode BUILD.EMC and store the output in BUILD.TXT just type:
<UL><LI><KBD>
DEMC <U>build.emc</U> ><U>build.txt</U></KBD></LI></UL>
<I>Emcc</I> works in reverse way. It takes text file and saves it as EMC file. The usage is:
<UL><LI><KBD>
EMCC in out</KBD></LI></UL>
So if you like to make a BUILD.EMC out of text file called NEW.TXT simply write:
<UL><LI><KBD>
EMCC <U>new.txt</U> <U>build.emc</U></KBD></LI></UL>
