To build this library you need the following:

* cmake (http://www.cmake.org)
* libsamplerate (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/index.html)

To build the python bindings (required for the command line tool) you
additionally need:

* python (http://www.python.org/)

To build the SDL_eastwood library you also need:

* SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
* SDL_mixer (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

Building of the optional features can be enabled and disabled by the following
variables:
LIBEASTWOOD_BUILD_SDL
LIBEASTWOOD_BUILD_PYTHON

For building ie. with python bindings, but without SDL_eastwood on *nix:
cmake -DLIBEASTWOOD_BUILD_SDL=0 -DLIBEASTWOOD_BUILD_PYTHON=1
make
